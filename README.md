# Ship-In-Space
Fly a ship through space and blow up stuff

This is my attempt at working out the mechanics of Asteroid in 7 days.

Day 1
Movement and rotation.
Easy simple code. Had to do some weird transform rotation to use built in methods like forward and rotate.

Day 2
"slide" when movement ends.
Really need to work on writing clean code.

Day 3
Cleaning up code and firing shots.
